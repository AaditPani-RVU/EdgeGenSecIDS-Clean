# EdgeGenSec AI

**EdgeGenSec AI** is a lightweight, edge-deployable Intrusion Detection System (IDS) enhanced with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It is designed to improve the detection of cyber-attacks on constrained edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB). By leveraging synthetic data generated by a GAN, the system aims to boost anomaly detection accuracy even in data-scarce environments.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is a **Work in Progress (WIP)**. Features and models are under active development and subject to change.

## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 Objective

To enhance real-time intrusion detection by training models with a blend of real and GAN-generated synthetic attack traffic. The system is optimized for edge deployment with quantized models and low-latency inference.

## 🧩 Components

### 🧠 1. MobileNetV2 (Quantized Classifier)
- Acts as the primary IDS model.
- Optimized for edge hardware with quantization.
- Performs real-time classification of network traffic as normal or malicious.

### 🤖 2. MobileGAN
- A compact Generative Adversarial Network adapted for edge devices.
- Generates synthetic cyber-attack traffic to augment the dataset and improve robustness.

### 🕵️ 3. Discriminator
- A model trained to distinguish between real and synthetic traffic.
- Helps in refining the GAN and ensuring quality of synthetic samples.
